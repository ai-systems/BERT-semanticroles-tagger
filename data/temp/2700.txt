Definition: <p><b>Definition:</b>An observation that is considered to be desirable to occur in the future.

This contrasts with goal which doesn't represent an intention to act, merely a hope for an eventual result. A goal is distinct from the intended actions to reach that goal. "I will reduce the dose of drug x to 20mg" is an intent. "I hope to be able to get the patient to the point where I can reduce the dose of drug x to 20mg" is a goal.
